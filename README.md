# CSS through HTML Extension for Visual Studio Code

The **CSS through HTML** extension for Visual Studio Code simplifies the process of creating CSS styles from classes and IDs defined in HTML files. This tool allows you to quickly generate CSS rules, improving efficiency in the development of your web projects.

## SUPPORT FOR:

- HTML
- REACT
- ANGULAR

## Features

- **Quick Style Creation:** Automatically generates CSS rules from classes and IDs found in the selected HTML code.

- **Support for Classes and IDs:** Recognizes both classes (`class`) and IDs (`id`) in the HTML code.

- **CSS File Creation:** Automatically creates CSS files in the same folder as the active HTML file if they do not exist.

- **Integration with Visual Studio Code:** Access extension functionalities directly from Visual Studio Code, enhancing your workflow.

## Usage Instructions

1. Select the HTML code from which you want to generate CSS styles.

2. Run the extension from the Visual Studio Code command menu.
   - For a specific selection, use the command `CSS through HTML: Include on CSS`.
   - To generate styles from the entire HTML content, use `CSS through HTML: Include All CSS`.

3. Another option (and the most practical one) is through the right-click context menu, which has the same names.

4. The extension will automatically create CSS rules based on the classes and IDs found.

5. The styles will be inserted into an existing CSS file or a new one will be created in the same folder as the active HTML file.
